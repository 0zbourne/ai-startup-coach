# ai-startup-coach
MVP for an AI co-pilot that helps future founders turn ambition into daily action.

## The Problem

Ambitious individuals struggle to bridge the gap between their vision and their daily to-do list. They get lost in "busywork" and distractions because they lack a clear, personalized system for prioritization.

## Our Solution

It is an app that:
1.  Helps you define your long-term goal through a simple onboarding flow.
2.  Provides you with a single, prioritized "Today's Focus" task.
3.  Includes a "Brain Dump" feature to capture distracting ideas without losing focus.
